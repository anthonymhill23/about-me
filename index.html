  <p> Hello, My name is Anthony. Im 32 years old. I'm a junior full stack developer currently enrolled at code fellows.
    The reason I joined code fellows at this stage in my life was due to me being miserable in my last career field. I
    loved satellite communications at one point but at some point I began to hate it. I've always been interested in how
    coding worked. So after finding out that I could use my GI bill to pay for my classes. I decided to go this route
    for boot camp. I have 5 kids (3 boys, 2 girls) My oldest is 13 and my youngest are 5 (I had twins this last go
    round) I push myself to do this so I can create a better life for them, for myself and for future people in my
    bloodline.
  </p>
