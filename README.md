### Reflections and Comments

Comments I need to practice more coding, this was a bit much for day two. but they said it would be difficult. Im not happy with it as it currently stands.

It took me several hours due to being lost for a while. I finally figured out how to add what I wanted to add, as well as trying put different text styles.I think the main thing I noticed is once you start flowing and see what you gotta do, this is very fun to do. Also using the live server and having the console open on your page can be a LIFE saver when troubleshooting code.
Consider including the answers to your daily journal and submission questions here
This is also a good place to reflect on the tools and resources used and learned
